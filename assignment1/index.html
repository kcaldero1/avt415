  <h2>History</h2>
    <p>This breed is said to have originated in China. But until now, the exact date is still unknown. With its interesting features, it slowly became very popular, making its way to Europe through traders and merchants navigating and passing through the Silk Route.
    The earliest recorded account about Silkie chickens is dated back in the 13th century. Marco Polo wrote about his travels in Asia, and he mention a furry chicken. Researchers suggest he was referring to the Silkies. Silkies are very cool chickens!</p>


  <h2>Diet</h2>

    <p>Since it is a relatively small fowl, pelleted foods aren’t really considered ideal foods, especially for chicks. Depending on their age, they must be fed on chick grower or chick starter as it can be simply digested and can be purchased directly at your nearest pet shop.
    If you think that a commercial pet food doesn’t offer any perks, then you can feed them grass, lettuce, or cabbage. You can even give them food scraps and hot porridge. Apart from food, Silkies need to have access to clean and fresh water all the time.</p>

  <h2>Appearance</h2>

    <p>They have a broad, plump body with a short back and abundant chest. Their legs are short and grey and set wide apart for stability.
    The head of the Silkie is a crested pom pom, almost reminiscent of a bad hair day. The rooster’s comb is a walnut shape which is often hidden by feathers. In a pure bred the comb should be mulberry (deep red) in color. Another unique feature of these birds is the fact they have black skin. They have black bones. And, it’s not just the skin and bones that are black—they also have black- or gray-colored meat.</p>
